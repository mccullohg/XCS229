\item \points{3b}
Investigate why the training procedure behaves unexpectedly on dataset $B$, but
not on $A$. Provide hard evidence (in the form of math, code, plots, etc.) to
corroborate your hypothesis for the misbehavior. Remember, you should address
why your explanation does \emph{not} apply to $A$.

\textbf{Hint}: The issue is not a numerical rounding or over/underflow error.
